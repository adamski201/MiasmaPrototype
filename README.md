# Miasma
An open-world narrative-driven survival game, drawing inspiration from Project Zomboid, Stardew Valley, and Graveyard Keeper.

Current Features:
- Resource Gathering (Trees/Ores), including an inventory system.
- Ranged combat.
- Enemy AI using A* Pathfinding and a Finite State Machine to handle behavioural states.

Much of the focus of this project has been learning to develop in a flexible and scalable way - avoiding bad code such as tight coupling and adhering to SOLID principles where possible. 

Features in development:
- The current branch is dedicated to prototyping melee combat as this will be a large focus of the game. Creating an engaging and challenging melee combat system is difficult in a skewed top-down perspective so I'm currently examining games such as Hyper Light Drifter and Cat Quest to see what makes them work so well, although I am aiming for a more souls-like style of combat with slower, timing-based gameplay. In particular, I'm really interested in adopting Sekiro's method of using Parrys to create an attack window. Ultimately, I'd like to incorporate this but slow it down a bit.
